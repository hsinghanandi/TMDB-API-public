# TMDB-api
Implementation of TMDB API to fetch &amp; show movies data based on their Titles, Actors &amp; Genres. Users can also search for the latest trending movies of the week.

This was my Term1 project for my Post-Graduate Program, where I practiced the implementation of APIs and have come up with this product. This was made back in April 2021. I have used TMDB’s API to fetch data from their server and show them on my website.

I have made this website from scratch and being a developer, I’ve tried to implement the best of my design skills. I made a gorgeous card-style layout for my website, with a minimal look and feel to it.

### Features of this Project:
1. Search Movies by : Titles, Actors & Genres
2. Seach for TV shows
3. Search for Trending Movies of the Week

All the information is taken from https://developers.themoviedb.org and was used for educational purposes only.
